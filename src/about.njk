	<h2>The Journey</h2>
	<p>
		I am a self-taught software engineer from Morocco.
		I dropped out of college because I learned faster and better on my own terms. I've spent the last 6+ year
		figuring out how the world works by trying to build parts of it myself.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Freelancing:</strong> Spent years solving technical problems for people all over the world
			It was my school.</li>
		<li><strong>Web3:</strong> Got deep into decentralized tech, won some hackathons, and contributed to some big
			blockchains.</li>
		<li><strong>Bootstrapping:</strong> Tried to build my own products. Most failed, but they taught me more
			than any course ever could.</li>
		<li><strong>The Arabic Leetcode:</strong> Spent 2 years building a platform to help others learn what
			learned. It was one of the hardest things I've built.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>
		I don't have a fixed plan. I'm just here to build, learn, live, and see what happens next.
