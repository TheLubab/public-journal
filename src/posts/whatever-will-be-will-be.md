description: Making peace with the future

Recently, I watched a mystery horror series called From, and what stood out to me the most is the intro song. Which is a cover of a song called "Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)" performed in a darker style.


"Whatever Will Be, Will Be" stood out to me because it challenged my whole mindset.

We constantly try to predict our future, be it the success of a project, the weather, or even our dreams.

The issue is that no matter how great of "analysis" we do, we will always be certainly wrong.  

I've tried doing that hundreds times and every single time my analysis get crushed, when i predict success, i lose, when i predict loss, i win.

99% of the successful things in my life come from things i never even knew existed.

Even my wife, it's literally impossible for me to have predict that this woman will be my wife, i wasn't even able to predict her country, or even that i will get married at this age. It just happened.

Life does follow logic, but we are not able to grasp it due to how big it is.

If you have data big enough where you know every single little thing happening in the world right now in details, you may predict the future, but that's certainly impossible for humans and even machines.

There are ways to predict probability of a thing happening, but you are not predicting a thing, you are predicting the probability of a thing, which means in most times you will be wrong.

And to make things worse, humans judgment is always biased toward their current emotianal state, i've seen that in myself, i predict more negative outcomes when I'm not feeling well, and i predict positive outcomes when i feel good. And both predictions are wrong, but they affect my actions.

I'm trying to change my mindset to stop trying to predict the future, and become more blindfolded in the present, as in doing whatever i think is good without looking much into it.

Or in short, my motto will be **"whatever will be will be"**.
